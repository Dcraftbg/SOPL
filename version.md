# Change Log
 ## 0.12.3A
   - Fixed minor bugs to do with 64 bit division and multiplication
   - Added examples for euler problems.
 ## 0.12.2A
   - Added while loops
   - Added the ability to have expressions inside while loop conditions
   - Added the ability to have expressions inside if loop conditions
   - Added 'euler' folder for future euler problem examples
 ## 0.12.1A 
   - Added 'result' as part of OfP
   - Fixed bugs and minor issues
   - Updated examples to now include 'result' instead of = RAX
   - Made 'return' actually return a value from a function now (you are forced to return if you specify return value!)
   - Removed return stack - it was never really something that was planned to stick around, but was more like a temporary patch for returning back when we were migrating over to C x86 standards
   - More examples comming soon :D

 ## 0.12A 
   - Added +=, -=, *=, /= as SETOperations
   - Added evaluation (updated examples)
   - Added expressions
   - Added expression evaluation
   - Fixed ifs and added condition (conditions still don't get typechecked nor can they be evaluated with expressions (yet) - only with ofps: constants,local variables and registers)
   
 ## 0.11.12A
   - Moved +, -, *, / to a new Token type 'Operand'
 ## 0.11.11A
   - Added TEMPORARY if statements
   - Added else statements

   - Added boolean operations
   - Fixed testing
 ## 0.11.9A
   - Added local variables to scopes
   - Implemented the rest of the float32 registers
   - Added ability to assign strings (only cstrings currently), to variables
   - Also fixed bug related to ^ where strings wouldn't be counted as 'used' if assigned to variable
 ## 0.11.8A
   - Fixed architecture examples
   - Added obj-extension for architectures
   - Added flags for architectures
   - Added DLL importing (currently only works as extern)
   - Added DLL exporting (currently only works as global)
   - Removed auto-exporting of functions (you need to do dll_export to make them global now)
 ## 0.11.7A
   - Fixed a few bugs to do with string UUID overloading
   - Added pointers with types (*char, **int, etc.)
   - Added macros for type checking

 ## 0.11.6A
   - Changed local variables to now be on the stack
   - Merged parameters and local variables
   - Made big changes in terms of how things are handled
   - Preparing for the introduction of if else elif scopes
   - Removed OfP::PARAM and replaced it with Localvariable
 ## 0.11.5A
   - Changed flags to be less frustrating and more flexible (checkout [README](README.md#flags-and-versions))

 ## 0.11.4A 
   - Slowly transitioning towards the new modern syntax
   - Added a few windows 'headers'
   - Added types for constant definitions
   - Added constant overwritting
   - Made constant overwritting be allowed only if they are the same type (its pretty unreasonable to overwrite something with a different type unless its local which is still yet to be implemented)
   - Removed a lot of 'comment out' comments
   - Moved a lot of the TODO comments at the end of the file for easier tracking
 ## 0.11.3A
   - After a lot of consideration I have decided to remove the stack oriented out of sopl
 ## 0.11.2A

      - Updated [argstest.spl](examples/argstest.spl)
      - Updated [typecheck.spl](examples/mundane/typecheck.spl)

   - Made a lot of dramatic changes in terms of function/external syntax.
   - Added support for the rest of the registers in x86 64
   - Changed a lot of examples
   - Broke some of the examples
   - Broke dynamic functions like printf and scanf
   - Added mundane folder for examples that are not very interesting
   - List of entirely fixed examples:
      - Updated [constants.spl](examples/constants.spl)

        - Updated [stdio_files.spl](examples/mundane/helloC.spl)

   - List of partially broken examples (hopefully fixed in next Change log):
    - Broken [argstest.spl](examples/argstest.spl) - arguments to functions are still yet to be implemented with the new standard
    - Broken [div.spl](examples/div.spl) - broken because of a lot of other stupid reasons regarding the usage of idiv
    - Broken [functions.spl](examples/functions.spl) - for obvious reasons, functions are yet to be fixed with the new syntax
    - Broken [functions2.spl](examples/functions2.spl) - for obvious reasons, functions are yet to be fixed with the new syntax
    - Broken [typecheck.spl](examples/mundane/typecheck.spl) - broken because typechecking for arguments isn't implemented yet
    

   - Migrated to x64 and its style of syntax
   - Added architectures: 
   > **[NOTE]:** Checkout examples of architectures [here](examples/arcs/)

   - Added built in architectures:
      - windows_x86/win_x86
      - windows_x86_64/win_x86_64
      - linux_x86
      - linux_x86_64
   - If not specified with the -arc flag, the compiler would try to default to the current OS architecture, if it doesn't find it, it will inform you and prompt you to specify the architecture
   
 ## 0.10.1A
   - Made externals to use HashMap instead of Vector to reduce O(n) situation for finding externals
 ## 0.10A
   - Entirely changed the way scopes are handled! Broke a lot of examples with IF statements which are expected to be fixed in the next patch (NOTE: They are not fixed yet)
   - Prepared to add local variables, constants and more to scopes
 ## 0.9.2A
   - HUGE OPTIMIZATION because string system in rust is bad
   - fixed copying the entire string every time you get a single char
   - cut compile time by 18 TIMES
   - Added benchmarks for everything
 ## 0.9.1A
   - Optimized Strings (No benchmarks cuz I forgot :<)
   - Temprarily disabled chars
 ## 0.9A
   - Optimized Lexer Word processing and re-wrote basically the entirety of the lexer that isn't about strings and chars (planned for next update)
   - Huge optimization to Lexer cutting compile time in half as shown in [benchmark](rsc/benchmarks/1-0_9A.log)
   - Using shared references (Rc's) for locations which makes it so there are a lot less clones for locations
   - Preparation for optimization of everything in the near future:
     - strings in Lexer
     - chars in Lexer
     - currentFunction

   - Benchmarking is now officially a constant part of this project and information on performance is going to be shown there
   - Changed versions.md manual to display newest of sub minor versions at the top instead of the old minor version
   - Pin pointed causes of slow downs :D
 ## 0.8A
   - Changed all versions from sub minor to minor (0.0.1A -> 0.1A).
   - Changed all previous instances of sub-minor versions
   - Added Linux folder
   - Added [Linux/syscalls.spl](src/Linux/syscalls.spl)
   - Added [Linux/systable.txt](src/Linux/systable.txt)
   - Improved performance by removing unnecessary clones
   - Started working on deprecating the currentFunction system to improve it and prepare for the near future changes (Inspired by another [project](https://github.com/Dimitar85898/STAP) of mine by the name STAP)
   - Started preparing for optimzation and finishing some TODOs
   - Added -callstack flag for specifying the amount of space needed for localvars.
   - [Benchmarking](rsc/benchmarks/1-0_8A.log) to find out that defining a lot of constants leads to a lot of time taken for compiling (resolved in [0.9A](#09a), // The issue was actually with the lexer and not with the constants). 
     - At 350+ constants it takes roughly 10-8ms to evaluate which is a long time for such a simple thing.
   - Added project [resources](rsc)
    - Added [benchmarks](rsc/benchmarks)

 ## 0.7A 
   - Added C [stdio.spl](src/C/stdio.spl)

   - Changed [README.md](README.md) version syntax
   - *Added optimization to remove any strings that were declared inside of functions that didn't end up in the final build
 ## 0.6.2A
   - Added optimization for unused functions
   - Changed the flag -nuw to now be -nou with parameters for (all, funcs, externs, strings) to disable specific warnings from being shown

   - redid the entire function system to no longer use a callstack to make it more compatible with C
   - Fixed the majority of the errors to do with pop and remade them to use manual instructions I.E. sub rsp, 8 to expand the stack and move in the value by hand
   - Introduced 'rs' keyword for the return stack. Now you can do rs push and then the value (only works for registers currently)
   - Added examples for function parameters: 
    [functions.spl](examples/functions.spl)
    [argstest.spl](examples/argstest.spl)
   - Fixed examples to now use new function syntax as well as cstrings
   - Changed version.md syntax
   - Added new test cases:
    [basicHelloWorld.spl](examples/basicHelloWorld.spl)
